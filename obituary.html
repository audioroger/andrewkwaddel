					<h2>WADDELL â€“ Andrew Keith Waddell was born on April 1, 1960 and died April 7, 2012.</h2>
          <p>Andy simply, made the world a more beautiful place. He passionately created, celebrated and nurtured beauty in all he touched. He was a loving and caring friend, had an aesthetic genius, and was a classical music aficionado.</p>
          <p>Andy loved the symphony and having studied violin, knew each piece played intimately.</p>
          <p>Andy could bury himself in his books and lose himself to another time. Andy had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things design; interior design, garden design, architectural design and of Frank Lloyd Wright in particular. As a teenager he started pilgrimages to Frank Lloyd Wright buildings and continued that throughout his life until he had visited nearly every FLW building that is still standing.</p>
          <p>Everything was important to Andy, each detail, each thought, each action. He was a charming and gentle soul that cared deeply for all things living. His loving hands and patient teachings touched many and will be missed by all.</p>
          <p>Andy, a fifth generation Houstonian who was proud of his heritage and family history, graduated from Bellaire High School and Texas A&amp;M University where he studied Architecture and Design. After college he left Texas for Washington DC where he lived for 16 years before returning to Houston 10 years ago.</p>
          <p>He is survived by his devoted partner of 27 years, Kenneth Wiesehuegel, his sister Nancy Cobb (husband Bruce), brother Richard Waddell, niece Leslie Waddell and nephew Zachary Cobb (wife, Kimberlee). He was preceded in death by parents Rutherford and Dorothy (Mhoon) Waddell and brother Patrick.</p>
          <p>He will also be missed by countless members of the Waddell, Mhoon and Wiesehuegel families as well as numerous nearby and far off friends including his closest friends, family by any other name, Maureen McNamara, John Haba, Tim Delao and that entire clan.</p>
          <p>A memorial service will be held at Bradshaw Carter Funeral Home at 1734 West Alabama Street, Houston, Texas 77098 on Thursday April 19, 2012 beginning at 5:00 PM.</p>
